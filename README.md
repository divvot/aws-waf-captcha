# AWS WAF CAPTCHA

I wanted to play around with the AI so I decided to do something interesting.

And That's

## Requirements

* Tensorflow (keras)
* FastAPI
* curl_cffi
* Pillow
* Matplotlib (train)
* numpy

## Training

Check and run `train.py` it'll output a .keras file in models folder

P.S. I'm not a expert in AI.
